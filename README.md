# Face_emotion_Detaction_Open-cv
# Real time face Emotion detection using deep learning 
This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.
